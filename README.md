This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error related to loose comparison (==) of null and undefined values. The bug.js file shows how loose comparison can lead to unexpected behavior, particularly when dealing with undefined values. The bugSolution.js file provides the corrected code using strict equality (===).  Always prefer strict equality when checking for null or undefined for more robust and predictable code.
